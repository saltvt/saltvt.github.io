Elloo it's been a while! 😅 
I've been super busy and haven't kept up with the blog as much as I should, but I have good news!!! I'm debuting a new chibi model on the twitch channel August 31st! It's going to be fun, also probably going to do a 12 hour stream for that because it will mark 5 years streaming!

I've been working on a bunch of stuff for the stream and just streamers in general in my spare time. The next few months should be interesting and I'm excited. I wanted to also be a little more intentional with my time on stream so expect better graphics/stream schedules going forward.

Another thing that i'm doing in september is refactoring this website because I want to stylize it a bit more. I also wanted to add blog functionality via markdown so people can see previous posts. The previous posts are saved but I want people to see the progression over time. It's always cool to come back to webdev just to see how the landscape has changed every couple of years.

Lots of things happening!

love you guys!
