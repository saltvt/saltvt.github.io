Ok guys! Updates!

The last couple of months have been crazy! I did a CTF for the first time in forever and it was really fun honestly. Ended up coming in third which was surprising.
It's fall now and halloween is in about two weeks! Will probably end up doing some things for that on stream. I haven't really decided what to be fair but stay tuned for that. Also we will be doing some horror movie watch alongs in the discord.
More importantly, the ML grind is real and in my spare time I'm finishing up the creation of my own model for the experience. The backend for the application im going to put it in is almost done too! It feels like there isn't enough time in the day
to do everything honestly.I hope everyone is doing well and taking care of themselves. That's the most important thing. Anyways enough yap.
